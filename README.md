<h3 align="left">...About me:</h3>
<hr/>
I am Fabri, Full Stack Developer, Industrial Designer and Entrepreneur! I also have an advanced English level 🙋‍♂️. I studied at Henry to become a Full Stack Developer. I graduated at Renault Technical Institute, my technical knowledge ranges from computer design to manufacturing on machine (both manual and CAD/CAM). I also graduated as Industrial Designer at FAUD UNC where technical knowledge is combined with creativity and art. 

My name represents me a lot since it means manufacturer, and since childhood I have had my own projects, inventions, ventures and I have always been managing my own businesses, offering my own products, the most recent being Studio Omicron DI, started in 2015, where me and my team make models, prototypes, mock-ups and prop-replicas by comission. This has led me to develop an accelerated pace of group work and to carry out a wide variety of designs and works for numerous clients and companies, as well as having experience in customer service.
